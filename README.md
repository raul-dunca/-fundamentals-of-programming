# ðŸ’» Fundamentals of Programming - in Python

## Assignments
- [Assignment 01](https://github.com/raul-dunca/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment1) - basic problems meant to get us used to the Python programming language.
- [Assignment 02](https://github.com/raul-dunca/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment2) - implemented a `menu-driven` console application that works with complex numbers.
- [Assignment 03](https://github.com/raul-dunca/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment3) - implemented a `command-based` console application to administrate a programming contest, using **procedural and modular programming, input validation methods, specifications and tests**.
- [Assignment 04](https://github.com/raul-dunca/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment4) - implemented an application that manages books, **using feature-driven development and unit tests**.
- [Assignment 05](https://github.com/raul-dunca/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment5) - implemented a `CRUD` application that administrates a movie rental system, **using classes, feature-driven development, PyUnit test cases, custom exceptions, persistent storage using file-based repositories**.
- [Assignment 06](https://github.com/raul-dunca/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment6) - implemented an iterable data structure, together with sorting and filtering methods, that can be reusable in other projects.
- [Assignment 07](https://github.com/raul-dunca/fundamentals-of-programming-assignment7) - implemented a replica of the game [Obstruction](http://www.papg.com/show?2XMX) , **using object oriented programming, layered architecture, graphical-user interface, together with some basic computer AI the user can play against**.
## Exam
- [Exam](https://github.com/raul-dunca/fundamentals-of-programming-exam) - implemented a console-based version of the [Hammurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi_(video_game)) game.
